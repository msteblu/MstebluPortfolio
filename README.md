## Description

Welcome to my portfolio page! This is a REACT site where I showcase some of the projects I have built â€” individually or as a group. It provides descriptions of projects I have worked on, as well as links to further information about the applications and their repositories. You can also find more information about me and how to get into contact with me.

## Installation

To view the portfolio, navigate to the deployed GitHub pages [site](https://msteblu.github.io/MstebluPortfolio/).

_To install this application locally yourself, download and clone the files from this repository. Run 'npm install' to install the packages in the package.json (and once again within the *portfolio* folder). The portfolio can then be viewed on your local browser._

## Usage

After visiting the [portfolio](https://msteblu.github.io/MstebluPortfolio/), simply interact with the single page application to learn more about me. View various examples of some of my projects and visit the associated links (to the deployed applications and to their repositories). Use the navbar to learn more about me and to access my contact information and resume, or use the footer to find links to my GitHub, my LinkedIn, and my StackOverflow accounts.

_If the program was cloned, downloaded, and installed instead, get the application running by typing "npm start" into the command-line. All features of the application are then accessible through *localhost* on your browser or other applications._
